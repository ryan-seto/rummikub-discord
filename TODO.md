Bugs:
- end turn undo's everything even if the board is in a valid state need to update that

Features:
- Maybe be able to move tiles from board to hand? (So you don't have to undo)
- How to handle points scoring when a meld has 1 regular tile and 2 jokers? How to differentiate between a run or group

UI:
- Update aesthetics of different things
- No indication of invalid board state - Players don't know why they can't end turn until they try (maybe add popup)
- Change users to display name instead of Discord username, maybe?
