Bugs: 
- What happens when tile pool runs out of tiles?
- Implement and test end game phase / win condition
- Test if tiles can overlap visually 

Features:
- Test and implement timer, if timer reaches zero, auto undo turn and draw tile
- No way to restart game or start new game
- Maybe be able to move tiles from board to hand? (So you don't have to undo)
- Add sort by color or number for player's hand
-  "are you sure" popup for drawing a tile?

UI:
- Update aesthetics of different things
- No indication of invalid board state - Players don't know why they can't end turn until they try (maybe add popup)
- Change users to display name instead of Discord username
- smoother tile moving animations
