Bugs:
- end turn undo's everything even if the board is in a valid state need to update that
- Timer resets to 1:01 instead of 1:00 for some reason


Features:
- No way to restart game or start new game at the end, should be able to go back to lobby screen
- Maybe be able to move tiles from board to hand? (So you don't have to undo)
- Add a draw tile animation to indicate the new tile
- Variable timer in ready up screen: 30s, 1min, 2min
- How to handle points scoring when a meld has 1 regular tile and 2 jokers? How to differentiate between a run or group

UI:
- Update aesthetics of different things
- No indication of invalid board state - Players don't know why they can't end turn until they try (maybe add popup)
- Change users to display name instead of Discord username, maybe?
